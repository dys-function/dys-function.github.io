Heâ€™s not getting paid for this one, but the reward may be greater than any monetary sum. Coalescence also brings Keystone City newcomer Gunnar, leader of a group recently set on the trail of a sinister cult, into the fray of elaborate conspiracies involving ancient orders, mysterious threats, and ever-present neon hedonism. Strap in for an action-packed thrill-ride that picks up the loose threads of Dys:/function: Prelude and ties them into a Gordian knot of techno-webs that holds the very balance of our reality in question."
